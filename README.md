# RHEA-Inverse-Design-Using-VAE
This project explores the inverse design of materials using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework trained on a curated dataset of Refractory High-Entropy Alloys (RHEAs). By leveraging deep generative modeling, we aim to identify novel alloy compositions with desired mechanical properties, such as high yield strength or specific strength.
